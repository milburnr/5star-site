              <h2>Average Roof Replacement Costs in Texas (2025)</h2>

              <p>
                The average cost to replace a residential roof in Texas ranges from <strong>$7,000 to $25,000+</strong> depending on size and materials. Here's a breakdown by common home sizes:
              </p>

                <em>These estimates include complete tear-off, disposal, new underlayment, architectural asphalt shingles, all materials, and professional installation. Your actual cost may vary based on specific project requirements.</em>
              </p>

              <h2>Cost Per Square Foot: The Roofing Industry Standard</h2>

              <p>
                Roofing contractors typically price jobs by the "square" (100 square feet). Understanding this helps you evaluate quotes accurately:
              </p>

              <h3>Average Cost Per Square in Texas (2025):</h3>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Asphalt Shingles (3-Tab):</strong> $350-$500 per square ($3.50-$5.00 per sq ft)</li>
                <li><strong>Architectural Shingles:</strong> $450-$650 per square ($4.50-$6.50 per sq ft)</li>
                <li><strong>Impact-Resistant Shingles:</strong> $550-$800 per square ($5.50-$8.00 per sq ft)</li>
                <li><strong>Metal Roofing:</strong> $800-$1,400 per square ($8.00-$14.00 per sq ft)</li>
                <li><strong>TPO/Commercial:</strong> $600-$900 per square ($6.00-$9.00 per sq ft)</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Factors That Affect Your Roof Replacement Cost</h2>

              <h3>1. Roof Size and Complexity</h3>
              <p>
                Larger roofs cost more—that's obvious. But complexity matters just as much:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Simple gable roof:</strong> Easiest and cheapest to replace</li>
                <li><strong>Hip roof:</strong> More complex, requires more materials</li>
                <li><strong>Multiple valleys and dormers:</strong> Increases labor time and material waste</li>
                <li><strong>Complex architecture:</strong> Turrets, multiple levels, and unique designs add 20-30% to costs</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>2. Roof Pitch (Steepness)</h3>
              <p>
                Steeper roofs are harder and more dangerous to work on:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Low pitch (4/12 or less):</strong> Standard pricing</li>
                <li><strong>Medium pitch (5/12 to 8/12):</strong> Standard to slightly increased</li>
                <li><strong>Steep pitch (9/12+):</strong> Adds 20-40% due to safety equipment and slower work</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>3. Number of Layers to Remove</h3>
              <p>
                Most Texas homes have 1-2 layers of shingles. Removal affects cost:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>One layer:</strong> Standard removal cost</li>
                <li><strong>Two layers:</strong> Adds $1,000-$2,500 in disposal fees</li>
                <li><strong>Three layers:</strong> Not allowed by code—must remove all (adds $2,000-$3,500)</li>
              </ul>

              <div className="bg-yellow-50 border-l-4 border-yellow-500 p-6 my-8">
                <p className="font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">⚠️ Important Note:</p>
                <p className="text-gray-700">
                  Some contractors offer to "overlay" new shingles on top of old ones to save money. <strong>We strongly recommend against this.</strong> It voids most manufacturer warranties, hides underlying damage, adds unnecessary weight, and shortens your new roof's lifespan.
                </p>
              </div>

              <h3>4. Material Quality and Type</h3>
              <p>
                Not all roofing materials are created equal. Here's what affects material costs:
              </p>

              <h4>Asphalt Shingle Quality Tiers:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>3-Tab Shingles:</strong> $80-$110 per square (basic, 20-25 year life)</li>
                <li><strong>Architectural/Dimensional:</strong> $110-$150 per square (standard, 30-40 year life)</li>
                <li><strong>Premium Architectural:</strong> $150-$200 per square (enhanced, 40-50 year life)</li>
                <li><strong>Designer Shingles:</strong> $200-$350 per square (luxury, 50+ year life)</li>
              </ul>

              <h4>Impact-Resistant (Class 4) Upgrades:</h4>
              <p>
                For Texas homeowners in hail-prone areas (which is most of us), Class 4 impact-resistant shingles add $50-$100 per square but:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Withstand larger hail (up to 2" tested)</li>
                <li>Qualify for 10-30% insurance discounts (saves $100-$300/year)</li>
                <li>Backed by stronger warranties</li>
                <li>Pay for themselves in 5-7 years through insurance savings</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>5. Ventilation and Underlayment</h3>
              <p>
                Proper ventilation and quality underlayment are critical in Texas:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Ridge vents:</strong> $3-$7 per linear foot (essential for Texas heat)</li>
                <li><strong>Synthetic underlayment:</strong> Adds $200-$500 (better than felt paper)</li>
                <li><strong>Ice & water shield:</strong> $100-$300 (protects valleys and eaves)</li>
                <li><strong>Attic ventilation upgrades:</strong> $500-$1,500 (reduces cooling costs)</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>6. Geographic Location in Texas</h3>
              <p>
                Location affects pricing due to labor costs, material delivery, and local competition:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Major metros (Dallas, Houston, Austin):</strong> Higher labor costs (10-20% above average)</li>
                <li><strong>West Texas (Amarillo, Lubbock, Midland, Odessa):</strong> Average to slightly below average costs</li>
                <li><strong>Rural areas:</strong> May pay premium for travel time or have fewer contractor options</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Cost Breakdown: What You're Actually Paying For</h2>

              <p>
                Understanding where your money goes helps you evaluate quotes:

              <div className="bg-gray-50 p-6 rounded-lg my-6">
                <ul className="space-y-2">
                  <li><strong>Materials (shingles, underlayment, nails, etc.):</strong> $5,000-$6,000 (33-40%)</li>

              <h2>How to Save Money on Roof Replacement</h2>

              <h3>Smart Ways to Reduce Costs:</h3>

              <ol>
                <li><strong>File an insurance claim:</strong> If you have hail/wind damage, insurance covers replacement minus your deductible ($1,000-$5,000 typically)</li>
                <li><strong>Get multiple quotes:</strong> Compare 3-4 contractors but don't automatically choose the lowest bid</li>
                <li><strong>Schedule in off-season:</strong> Winter months (Nov-Feb) sometimes have lower rates</li>
                <li><strong>Consider impact-resistant shingles:</strong> Higher upfront cost but insurance discounts provide long-term savings</li>
                <li><strong>Do your own cleanup:</strong> Some contractors will discount if you handle yard cleanup</li>
                <li><strong>Don't upgrade unnecessarily:</strong> Match your current roof quality unless there's a specific reason to upgrade</li>
              </ol>

              <h3>DON'T Try to Save Money By:</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>❌ Accepting "layover" instead of tear-off</li>
                <li>❌ Hiring unlicensed contractors</li>
                <li>❌ Choosing the absolute cheapest materials</li>
                <li>❌ Skipping proper ventilation</li>
                <li>❌ Accepting a contractor who offers to "waive your deductible" (this is insurance fraud)</li>
              </ul>

              <div className="bg-brand-gold-light p-6 rounded-lg my-8">
                <p className="font-semibold text-brand-brown mb-2">💡 Insurance Claims Can Save You Thousands</p>
                <p>
                  If your Texas home has hail damage from recent storms, insurance typically covers 100% of replacement costs minus your deductible. A $16,000 roof replacement might only cost you $2,000-$4,000 out of pocket.

              <h2>Texas-Specific Roofing Cost Considerations</h2>

              <h3>Hail Damage Impact on Costs</h3>
              <p>
                Texas leads the nation in hail damage claims. If your roof has hail damage:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Most insurance covers full replacement</li>
                <li>You typically only pay your wind/hail deductible (1-5% of home value)</li>
                <li>Upgrading to Class 4 impact-resistant shingles often covered at no additional cost</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Energy Efficiency Upgrades</h3>

                Texas heat demands energy-efficient roofing:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Cool roof shingles:</strong> Reflect more sunlight, reduce cooling costs 10-15%</li>
                <li><strong>Radiant barriers:</strong> $200-$800, reduce attic heat by 30°F+</li>
                <li><strong>Improved ventilation:</strong> $500-$1,500, extends roof life and reduces energy costs</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

              <h3>Can I do a roof replacement myself to save money?</h3>
              <p>
                While technically possible, we <strong>strongly discourage DIY roof replacement</strong>:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Roofing is dangerous (falls are a leading cause of construction injuries)</li>
                <li>Mistakes void manufacturer warranties</li>
                <li>Improper installation leads to leaks and premature failure</li>
                <li>Most insurance won't cover DIY work</li>
                <li>Resale value impact if not professionally installed</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                The money saved isn't worth the risk. Hire a licensed, insured professional.
              </p>

              <h3>How do I know if I'm getting a fair price?</h3>
              <p>
                Get 3-4 quotes from licensed contractors. If all quotes are in a similar range ($12k-$15k for example), that's market rate. If one is dramatically lower ($8k), they're likely:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Using inferior materials</li>
                <li>Cutting corners (skipping ventilation, using cheap underlayment)</li>
                <li>Planning a layover instead of tear-off</li>
                <li>Unlicensed/uninsured</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Should I finance my roof replacement?</h3>
              <p>
                Financing options include:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Contractor financing:</strong> Many offer 0% for 12-24 months</li>
                <li><strong>Home equity loan/HELOC:</strong> Lower interest rates</li>
                <li><strong>Credit cards:</strong> Last resort (high interest)</li>
                <li><strong>Insurance claim:</strong> Best option if you qualify</li>
              </ul>

              <h3>When is the best time of year to replace a roof in Texas?</h3>
              <p>
                <strong>Fall (September-November) and Spring (March-May)</strong> are ideal:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Moderate temperatures (better for shingle installation)</li>
                <li>Less rain than summer</li>
                <li>Not freezing (winter can complicate installation)</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                However, emergency replacements don't wait for perfect weather. Professional contractors can work safely year-round.

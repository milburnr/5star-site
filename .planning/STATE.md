## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: Compliance fixes (AggregateRating removal, entity standardization) are phase 1 — non-negotiable ordering per research
- [Roadmap]: URL canonicalization before any content work — improving redirected pages is wasted effort
- [Roadmap]: TECH requirements assigned to Phase 10 as final validation gate, though build verification happens informally every phase
- [01-01]: Removed AggregateRating from reviews page too -- 500 claimed reviews vs ~12 visible testimonials is still fabricated
- [01-01]: Cleaned fix-seo-gaps.js generator to prevent AggregateRating recontamination on future page creation
- [01-02]: Blog/Gallery schema name fields kept as-is (describe page entities, not business entity)
- [01-02]: Script targets only schema property contexts to avoid modifying meta titles or text content
- [02-01]: All redirect targets use suffix-free /{service}-{city}/ pattern matching InternalLinks component
- [02-01]: Variant page.tsx files updated in place (not deleted yet -- deletion is plan 02-02)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- GBP authoritative business name needs confirmation before Phase 1 entity standardization
- No live GSC data available — baseline export should happen before Phase 1 deploys
- R2 image baseline audit should run before any changes to catch pre-existing broken URLs
